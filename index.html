        <p>This is webiste is great,this is going to be a random website with random
            pictures of dogs, beaches and a picture of a window. This project took 
            a lot of time and effort but at the end it was worth the learning experience.
            I did the best I could, followed the given Information, did not look at any finished
            work of the same project. <a href="https://www.google.com/" style="color: yellow;" > Google </a>
            , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" style="color: red;" > Youtube  </a>, 
            and of course <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" style="color: black;" > Stack Overflow</a>  were 
            a huge help. There is a lot of messy code that was done to make this site possible.

            This reminds me of the times I went to Hawaii and went to the beach. Listening to the
        waves of the ocean is one of the best feelings in life in my opinion.</div>
